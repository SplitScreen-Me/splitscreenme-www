Which games can be splitscreened using Nucleus Co-Op?

There are a lot of supported games, the full list of supported games can be found [here(reddit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nucleuscoop/comments/opu0eg/list_of_nucleus_coop_supported_games/), or [here(the hub)](https://hub.splitscreen.me/).

A ton of games are now supported thanks to the amazing program called [Goldberg Emulator](https://gitlab.com/Mr_Goldberg/goldberg_emulator), developed by Mr. Goldberg, a big thank you to him. 
Read the [Goldberg FAQ](https://gitlab.com/Mr_Goldberg/goldberg_emulator/-/blob/master/README.md) if you want to know more.

*Do you not see the game you want to play in the list of supported games? Request it in the comment section [here](https://sites.google.com/view/nucleuscoopwishlist/wishlist-sourcesheet), or check out [this guide](/docs/create-handlers) on how to create a handler for that game yourself. For more info on handlers, see [what are handlers?](/docs/handlers).*
