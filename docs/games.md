title: Which games are supported?
---

There are currently more than 400 supported games, you can see all in the [handlers hub](https://hub.splitscreen.me/) and in the [list of supported games](https://www.reddit.com/r/nucleuscoop/comments/opu0eg/list_of_nucleus_coop_supported_games/). 

In the [game handlers hub](https://hub.splitscreen.me/) you will be able to explore all the available Nucleus Co-op [handlers](/docs/handlers) very easily and download the handlers directly without using the app, you will also be able to see the handler code, its version history, see extra information related to the handler and game and give each handler points (hotness).

Remember to only download handlers that have been verified by the SplitScreen.Me team as fully safe (you will see the verified green icon).

A ton of games are now supported thanks to the amazing program called [Goldberg Emulator](https://gitlab.com/Mr_Goldberg/goldberg_emulator), developed by Mr. Goldberg, a big thank you to him. Read the [Goldberg FAQ](https://gitlab.com/Mr_Goldberg/goldberg_emulator/-/blob/master/README.md) if you want to know more.

*Do you not see the game you want to play in the list of supported games? Request it or check out [this guide](/docs/create-handlers) on how to create a handler for that game yourself. For more info on handlers, see [what are handlers?](/docs/handlers).*
