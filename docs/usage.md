* Click on the handler cover and be sure to read through the guide or info for the game.

* When Nucleus asks to add the game, click Yes and browse to the game executable. Most Steam games will be in `C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\`. Some games will have their real .exe stashed away in a folder called `bin` or `binaries`.

* If you already have the game handler (.js) inside Nucleus Co-op handlers folder you can click `Search Game` to add the game to Nucleus Co-op.

* You can also download the handlers from the [website handlers hub](https://hub.splitscreen.me/), then in Nucleus Co-op select `Extract Handler` or `Extract Existing`, choose the .nc file you downloaded and add the game.

* Once your game is added, select it in the Nucleus Co-op UI and assign the input devices to parts of the screen by dragging the devices. The input devices icons will show and light up when they receive input (maintain a button press for controllers). Change the layout of each screen by clicking the icon in the top-left corner of each screen, if you have multiple monitors connected they will show in the UI.

* Read the handler author's notes below the game cover, read them carefully as they contain important information related to the handler functionality.

* When you are ready, click the `>` button. If there are any handler UI options, configure them. Then press `PLAY`.

* Wait a bit for the games to start and their windows to be resized and positioned. If you are using multiple keyboards and mice, you may have to press the `End` key to lock the input after the games are set up for the keyboards/mice to work correctly.

* Follow the game handler notes to connect the games together.
