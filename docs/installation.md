* When it asks you for a password write `nucleus` and extract.

Note: Some Nucleus Co-op hook dlls and Goldberg emulator, used by Nucleus, can sometimes be detected by windows defender and other anti-viruses and web browsers: this is 100% a false positive see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nucleuscoop/comments/g2k8j7/is_there_any_viruses/fnmfhbp/) and [here](https://gitlab.com/Mr_Goldberg/goldberg_emulator/-/issues/118). You may have to allow Nucleus as an exception before extracting. Do not overwrite old Nucleus Co-op versions files with new ones, make a clean install.

* Move the Nucleus Co-op folder to wherever you like, and run NucleusCoop.exe

  * You can place the folder wherever you like as long as you keep the following in mind:

    * DO NOT place it inside a folder containing files for a game you wish to play.

    * Avoid placing it inside a folder that has security settings applied to it, such as Program Files, Program Files (x86).

    * Some handlers require the Nucleus Co-op folder to be located in the same drive as the game files.

    * If you are still unsure where to place the folder, the root of the drive your games are installed on is usually the best option. For example C:/NucleusCo-op

:::tip How To Download Earlier Versions 
You can download earlier versions of Nucleus Co-op from [Lucas's](https://github.com/lucasassislar/nucleuscoop)
or [Zerofox's](https://github.com/ZeroFox5866/nucleuscoop/releases) GitHub repos. Note that these versions will not
support as many games, and that we no longer provide support for earlier versions.
