title: What is SplitScreen.Me?
---
[SplitScreen.Me](https://github.com/SplitScreen-Me) is an [organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations) that aims to reunite all split-screen open source projects under one banner.

## SplitScreen.Me Programs:
### Nucleus Co-op
[Nucleus Co-op](/docs/faq) is a free and open source tool for Windows that allows split-screen play on many games that do not initially support it. Its purpose is to make it as easy as possible for the average user to play games locally using only one PC and one game copy. The app was originally created by [Lucas Assis](https://github.com/lucasassislar). The developer [Zerofox](https://github.com/ZeroFox5866) later took over and added a ton of new features and improvements to support a lot more games. [Ilyaki](https://github.com/Ilyaki) later joined in and brought multiple keyboards/mice support, extended hooks support and more great features to the table. Finally [Mikou27](https://github.com/Mikou27) added a new beautiful overhauled user interface with support for themes, game covers and screenshots, among many other quality of life improvements and scaling bug fixes.

[R-mach](https://github.com/r-mach) is the creator and developer of the SplitScreen.Me website that hosts all the available Nucleus Co-op game handlers.

The further development of the app wouldn't have been possible without the amazing contributions and hard work from all the Split Screen Dreams Discord members (which include the devs mentioned above) that made all the new Nucleus Co-op game handlers and continue to test the app, make new discoveries and game handlers to support even more games, among them: [Talos91](https://hub.splitscreen.me/user/eeL7HAz8zJovChWw4), [PoundlandBacon](https://hub.splitscreen.me/user/AdiAjSyfZPMvu3a4M), [dr. old.boi](https://hub.splitscreen.me/user/dPRj3q6kFtT4HvMGg), [Pizzo](https://hub.splitscreen.me/user/HEgozNi3MNvhAmWfi) and many more.

### Proto Input
[Proto Input](/docs/proto) is the set of libraries used by Nucleus Co-op to inject games with hooks for input (mainly multiple keyboards/mice) as well as window focus faking, etc. Developed by [Ilyaki](https://github.com/Ilyaki) Proto Input is a massive improvement over the original hooks inside Nucleus Co-op and Universal Split Screen. Proto Input can also be used independently without opening Nucleus.

### Universal Split Screen

[Universal Split Screen](https://universalsplitscreen.github.io/) is a standalone application that directs Windows input to enable local multiplayer in PC games with keyboards, mice and controllers. Universal Split Screen has been superseded by Proto Input, which is part of Nucleus Co-op now but it is still a very useful app for many purposes, the app was developed by [Ilyaki](https://github.com/Ilyaki) too.
