[SplitScreen.Me](https://github.com/SplitScreen-Me) is an [organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations) that aims to reunite all split-screen open source projects under one banner.

## SplitScreen.Me Programs:
### Nucleus Co-op
[Nucleus Co-op](/docs/faq) is a free and open source tool for Windows that allows split-screen play on many games that do not initially support it, the app purpose is to make it as easy as possible for the average user to play games locally using only one game copy and one PC. 

### Proto Input
[Proto Input](/docs/proto) is the set of libraries used by Nucleus Co-op to inject games with hooks for input (mainly multiple keyboards/mice) as well as window focus faking, etc. Developed by [Ilyaki](https://github.com/Ilyaki) Proto Input is a massive improvement over the original hooks inside Nucleus Co-op and Universal Split Screen. Proto Input can also be used independently without opening Nucleus.

### Universal Split Screen

[Universal Split Screen](https://universalsplitscreen.github.io/) is a standalone application that directs Windows input to enable local multiplayer in PC games with keyboards, mice and controllers. Universal Split Screen has been superseded by Proto Input, which is part of Nucleus Co-op now but it is still a very useful app for many purposes, the app was also developed by [Ilyaki](https://github.com/Ilyaki).
