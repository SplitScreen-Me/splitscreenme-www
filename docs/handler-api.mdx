## Introduction

Nucleus Co-op is a free and open source tool for Windows that allows split-screen play on many games that do not initially support it, the app purpose is to make it as easy as possible for the average user to play games locally using only one PC and one game copy.

<https://github.com/SplitScreen-Me/splitscreenme-nucleus>

This is a new and improved official version of the Nucleus Co-op application and is part of the SplitScreen.Me github organization, it includes the following:

### 1.  Game Info

The name of the game executable with the extension. This will be used by Nucleus to add games, to run the game and as process to follow for positioning and resizing.

```js
  Game.ExecutableName = "Game.exe";
```

---
If the game is to launch a different executable, other than what Game.ExecutableName is.

```js
  Game.ExecutableToLaunch = "Game.exe";
```

---
If the game needs to go through a launcher before opening Nucleus will use this exe to start the game and it will still use the Game.ExecutableName process for positioning and resizing.

```js
  Game.LauncherExe = "Launcher.exe";
```

---
The name of the folder that will be created inside the Nucleus content folder (just use letters not symbols). In this folder Nucleus will store the symlinked or copied game files for each instance of the game.

```js
  Game.GUID = "Game Name";
```

---
Title of the game that will be shown in Nucleus.

```js
  Game.GameName = "Game Name";
```

---
The name of the launcher's window title. Some games need to go through a launcher to open. This is needed or else the application will lose the game's window.

```js
  Game.LauncherTitle = "Launcher Window Title";
```

---
This is just info. It will not limit the players number.

```js
  Game.MaxPlayersOneMonitor = 4;
```

---
This is just the max players info that shows under the handler name in Nucleus UI. Usually we write the max number of players the game supports. (PC, should support 16 max connected input devices).

```js
  Game.MaxPlayers = 16;
```

---

### 2.  Mutex

Specify the type of mutex/handle to kill, for example "Mutant", "Event" or "Semaphore" | default: "Mutant".

```js
  Game.KillMutexType = "Mutant";
```

---
\# of seconds to wait before killing the mutex | Only works with killing not renaming | default: 0.

```js
  Game.KillMutexDelay = 10;
```

---
Instead of killing the mutex or handle, rename it on startup to something else | Requires Game.KillMutex to contain the EXACT name of the handles for this to work (no partial).

```js
  Game.RenameNotKillMutex = true;
```

---
When killing handles, should a partial search be done with the handle name? | Renaming handles requires an exact match | default: false.

```js
  Game.PartialMutexSearch = false;
```

---
Kill the handles, specified in Game.KillMutex, in the last instance (normally last is ignored).

```js
  Game.KillLastInstanceMutex = false;
```

---
When using ProcessChangesAtEnd, should handles also be killed at the end?.

```js
  Game.KillMutexAtEnd = false;
```

---
When using Game.MutexProcessExe, here you can specify the handles that need to be killed.

```js
Game.KillMutexProcess = ["Mutexes","To","Close"];
```

---
When using Game.MutexProcessExe, here you can specify if you want to do a partial search for handles.

```js
  Game.PartialMutexSearchProcess = false;
```

---
When using Game.MutexProcessExe, here you can specify the type of handles to kill.

```js
  Game.KillMutexTypeProcess = "Mutant";
```

---
Specify another executable to kill handles for.

```js
  Game.MutexProcessExe = "Process.exe";
```

---
Wait for X number of seconds before proceeding with mutex killing.

```js
  Game.PauseBeforeMutexKilling = 1000;
```

---
When using Game.MutexProcessExe, wait for X number of seconds before beginning its mutex killing.

```js
  Game.KillMutexDelayProcess = 1000;
```

---

### 3.  File System

If we should symbolic link the game's files to a temporary directory (Nucleus instances folders in its content folder). If not will launch straight from the installation directory.

```js
  Game.SymlinkGame = true;
```

---
If SymlinkGame is enabled, if we should copy or symlink the game executable.

```js
  Game.SymlinkExe = false;
```

---
Folders by default are hardcopied, with this enabled, folders will be symlinked instead | warning files placed in symlink folders will appear in the original game files too.

```js
  Game.SymlinkFolders = false;
```

---
Enable or disable symlink files from being deleted when Nucleus is closed | default: false.

```js
  Game.KeepSymLinkOnExit = true;
```

---
Symlink individual files from the game directory to the instanced folder.

```js
Game.SymlinkFiles = ["game.exe","settings.cfg"];
```

---
Copy files from the game directory to the instanced folder.

```js
  Game.CopyFiles = ["game.exe","settings.cfg"]; 
```

---
Instead of Symlinking, create hard copies of the games files (copy/paste) | Be careful of storage, takes a LONG time to start a game when copying.

```js
  Game.HardcopyGame = true;
```

---
Hardlink files instead of Symlink (or hard copy) | Directories will still be symlinked but files will be hardlinked.

```js
  Game.HardlinkGame = false;
```

---
Force game to be symlinked each time it is ran.

```js
  Game.ForceSymlink = false;
```

---
Array with the name of the folders you don't want Nucleus Co-op to symlink, only the folders placed here get hardcopied not the files.

```js
  Game.DirSymlinkExclusions = ["folder1", "folder2"];
```

---
Array with the name of the files you don't want Nucleus Co-op to symlink, useful if you want to replace files or add external files.

```js
Game.FileSymlinkExclusions = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt"];
```

---  
Array with the name of the files you want Nucleus Co-op to make full copies of, in some cases games need certain files to be full copies or they won't run.

```js
Game.FileSymlinkCopyInstead = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt"];
```

Copy (not symlink) all files within a given folder | Folder name is relative from root game folder.

```js
Game.DirSymlinkCopyInstead = [ "folder1", "folder2" ];
```

---
When specifying folder(s) to copy all its contents instead of linking, should subfolders and files be included as well?

```js
Game.DirSymlinkCopyInsteadIncludeSubFolders = false;
```

---
Symlink folders in game root folder to another spot in game folder | Relative paths from root of game folder.

```js
Game.SymlinkFoldersTo = ["folderToMove|whereToMoveIt"];
```

---
Hardlink folders in game root folder to another spot in game folder | Relative paths from root of game folder.

```js
Game.HardlinkFoldersTo = ["folderToMove|whereToMoveIt"];
```

---
Will rename the game's executable to "\<exe name\> - Player X", x being the instance/player #.

```js
  Game.ChangeExe = true;
```

---
Copy a file or folder you specify between the quotes to each instance folder, if the file/folder is located in Nucleus folder\utils\User. This function also accepts two additional parameters, a relative path from the game root folder if the file needs to be placed somewhere else within instance folder and one parameter to indicate which instances to copy the file to if it only needs to be in some. Use of parameters is separated by a | character. So it would look something like this [ "filename.ini|\\bin|1,2" ]. This example would copy filename.ini from Nucleus\utils\User to Instance0\bin and Instance1\bin. If you don't specify which instances, it will do them all by default. If you don't specify a path then root instance folder is used. If you want instances but root folder you would just do [ "filename.ini||1,2" ] | If copying multiple files, use comma seperated strings

```js
  Game.CopyCustomUtils = [ "d3d9.dll" ]; 
```

Will do a text value replacement in a file for every instance, accepts two parameters, one on what to look for, and what it should be replaced with (seperated with a "|") | Works with multiple values | Works in conjunction with HexEditExe (this will trigger first).

```js
  Game.HexEditAllExes = [ "before|afters" ]; 
```

---
Will do a text value replacement in a file for a specific instance, accepts two parameters, one on what to look for, and what it should be replaced with (seperated with a "|") | Works with multiple values, each comma seperated string is the order of the instances | Works in conjunction with HexEditAllExe (this will trigger second).

```js
  Game.HexEditExe = [ "before|afters" ]; 
```

```js
  Game.HexEditFile = [ "filePath|before|afters" ]; 
```

```

---
Create a steam_appid.txt file where the game executable is.

```js
  Game.CreateSteamAppIdByExe = false;

  Game.LauncherExeIgnoreFileCheck = false; 
```

---

Copy folders in game root folder to another spot in game folder | Relative paths from root of game folder.

```js
  Game.CopyFoldersTo = ["folderToMove|whereToMoveIt"]; 
```

---
Use this to replace bytes in a file at a specified address, can be for specific instances with optional 3rd argument | 1st arg: instance # (optional), 2nd arg: hex address offset, 3rd arg: new bytes.

```js
  Game.HexEditExeAddress = [ "1|address|bytes" ]; 
```

---
Game.HexEditFileAddress = [ "1|relativePath|address|bytes" ]; //Same as HexEditExeAddress but for a file other than exe | Need to provide relative path (from game root folder) + filename as 1st or 2nd arg if not specifying an instance.
Do not display the warning message about a file being deleted .

```js
  Game.IgnoreDeleteFilesPrompt = false; 
```

---
Game.RenameAndOrMoveFiles = [ "1|before.dat|after.dat" ];//Specify files to either rename or move | can accept relative path from root | optional first parameter to specify a specific instance to apply to, omit to do them all.
Specify files to be deleted from instanced folder | can accept relative path from root | optional first parameter to specify a specific instance to apply to, omit to do them all.

```js
  Game.DeleteFiles = [ "1|delete.dis" ];

### 11. Nemirtingas Galaxy GoG Emulator

Nemirtinga's Galaxy Emulator works by substituting the game's Galaxy64.dll file with its own custom dll.

First, set up Nemirtinga's Galaxy Emulator in Nucleus.

```js
Game.UseNemirtingasGalaxyEmu = true;   //Set to true to emulate GOG Galaxy
```

It is recommended that the emulator is used on the game without Nucleus once before scripting. This can be done by the following steps:

1. Head to `NucleusCo-op\utils\NemirtingasGalaxyEmu`
2. Copy the `Galaxy64.dll` file.
3. Head to the installation folder of the game you wish to emulate.
4. Find where Galaxy64.dll is stored. This shall be called **the Galaxy folder**.
5. Rename Galaxy64.dll or move it from the Galaxy folder and paste the Galaxy64.dll from the NemirtingasGalaxyEmu folder.
6. Locate and load the game's executable.

This should generate a folder called ngalaxye_settings. This folder contains a .json file that keeps track of vital information. Keep track of where this folder is located as you will need it for the Nucleus script.

7. If the game loads fine and the game does not crash when trying to use multiplayer, then the emulator is working. Feel free to remove the ngalaxye_settings folder and Galaxy64.dll, and restore the original Galaxy64.dll file to the Galaxy folder.

With the steps above done, write inside the Game.Play() function:

```js
var idg = Context.PlayerID + 6;
var jsonPath = Context.GetFolder(Nucleus.Folder.InstancedGameFolder) + "\\ngalaxye_settings\\NemirtingasGalaxyEmu.json"; //The string should be changed so that ngalaxye_settings is in the same folder as it was in Step 6.
var params = [
'{',
'  "api_version": "1.139.2.0",', //Must be changed or the game cannot connect to LAN. API version can be found by right-clicking the original Galaxy64.dll, clicking the 'Details' tab and reading the File Version tag.
'  "enable_overlay": false,',
'  "galaxyid": 14549624462898294'+idg+',',
'  "language": ' + '"' + Context.GogLang + '",',
'  "productid": 2143654691,', //Must be changed or the game will crash. Product ID can be found by visitng https://www.gogdb.org/
'  "username": ' + '"' + Context.Nickname + '"', //Must always be added and must be the last line or else the emulator will reset all parameters (there is no comma at the end of this line in the json).
'}'
];

Context.WriteTextFile(jsonPath,params);
```

#### Common Errors

### Q. The game's multiplayer only works when GOG Galaxy is open and even then, I can only play with my friends on GOG Galaxy.
A. Make sure you set Game.UseNemirtingasGalaxyEmu = true

**Q. The game crashes upon entering the multiplayer gamemode or main menu.**
A. The game is either not loading the custom Galaxy64.dll file or not loading the .json file correctly. Make sure you set Game.UseNemirtingasGalaxyEmu = true, make sure that the ngalaxye_settings folder is in the correct place and make sure the .json file has the correct parameters (i.e. make sure productid and api_version is correct).

### Q. The game loads fine but I cannot connect to other players in Nucleus.
A. The api_version has been set incorrectly. Go to the game's installation folder, locate the Galaxy64.dll, click the 'Details' tab and read the File Version. That is what your api_version should be.

 ### 12. Additional Tools 

Use atom0s' Steamless app to remove Steam Stub DRM from a protected executable.
